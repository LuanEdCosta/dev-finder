## :heart: MOTIVATION

This is a simple project that I created for these purposes:

**1.** Learn how to use React to create web apps (I'm already working with React Native for a cuple months, but I didn't create a web project yet).

**2.** The use of Sass with React.

**3.** Improve my UI/UX skills in web.
