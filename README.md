# DEV FINDER

This website lets you search a Github user by his name using the Github public API.

## MOTIVATION

This is a simple project that i created for these reasons:

**1.** Learn how to use React to create web apps (since i'm already working with React Native for a cuple months, but i didn't create a web project yet).

**2.** The use of Sass with React.

**3.** Improve my UI/UX skills in web.
